# Snake

This repository contains a snake game written in Python which makes use of Pygame.

## Usage

Run the main game file `snake.py`. Press `space` to begin.
Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to change the direction the snake is traveling.
Increase the snakes size by eating the red food.
The game will continue until the snake enters a square it already occupies, 
upon which the window will close.
